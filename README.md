MVSelectorScrollView - Andrea Bizzotto <bizz84@gmail.com>

-------------------------------------------------------

This project includes a simple Cocoa control that can be used as an alternative for the standard UISegmentedControl provided by UIKit.

The control is made by a simple UIScrollView that can be scrolled horizontally to select amongst a set of NSString values.

The advantage over a traditional UISegmentedControl is that with MVSelectorScrollView it's easy to select up to a dozen of values.
